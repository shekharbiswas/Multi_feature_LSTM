# Stock Prediction using LSTM with News & Market Data

## Overview

Predict stock price movements for a volatile stock using an LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) model. Integrate multiple features, including historical price data, news sentiment, and other market factors. Evaluate the prediction model with various explainability methods to provide transparency into its decision-making process.

## Why Volatile Stock?

Choose **MSFT** for this prediction model due to its price volatility. Volatile stocks present more movement, which can be influenced by factors such as news sentiment, market conditions, and global events. This allows you to evaluate how well the model generalizes when learning from dynamic and complex data.

## 1. Data Collection

Ensure the accuracy of stock price prediction by leveraging high-quality, diverse data. Use a combination of:

- **Historical Stock Data**: This forms the foundation of the model. Use past price movements (e.g., open, close, high, low, volume) to predict future movements.
- **News Data**: Scrape news headlines and articles to capture sentiment, which can influence price direction.

### News Scraping & APIs

Select **[News API Platform]** (e.g., NewsAPI, Alpha Vantage, or another open-source API) for scraping news articles related to the chosen stock. Reasons for selecting the API:
- It is **open-source** and provides free access to real-time and historical news articles.
- It offers a **wide range of sources** from reputable news outlets, ensuring diversity in sentiment analysis.
- Filter by keywords, topics, and stock-related tags to focus on relevant news.

### Preprocessing & Structuring

Preprocess the data by cleaning and structuring both stock price data and news data. Steps include:
- **Stock Data**: Handle missing values, normalize prices, and create features such as moving averages, price differences, or volatility indicators.
- **News Data**: Clean and extract sentiment or keywords from news headlines and articles using Natural Language Processing (NLP).

### Combining with Stock Data

Merge the news data with historical stock data. Align timestamps of news with stock data and create a dataset that includes:
- Historical stock prices (open, close, high, low, volume)
- Sentiment scores derived from news articles related to the stock
- Technical indicators (e.g., moving averages, RSI)

## 2. Model Training & Evaluation

Build the predictive model using LSTM.

### Model Selection & Training

Choose **LSTM** for its ability to capture time dependencies in sequential data, making it ideal for time series forecasting like stock price prediction. Train the model using:
- Previous stock prices (historical data)
- Sentiment scores derived from news articles
- Additional features like moving averages or market volatility indicators

### Hyperparameter Tuning

Fine-tune hyperparameters for optimal performance, including:
- **Number of layers** and **units per layer**
- **Learning rate** and optimizer selection
- **Batch size** and **epochs**

Use techniques like **Grid Search** or **Random Search** for tuning.

### Model Validation & Testing

Validate the model using a separate test dataset to check generalization ability. Evaluate the model’s performance by:
- Calculating **accuracy**, **RMSE**, and **mean absolute error (MAE)**
- Comparing against a baseline model using only historical stock data (without news sentiment)

## 3. Explainability Methods

Implement explainability techniques to improve transparency and interpret the LSTM model's outputs.

### Counterfactual Explanations

Use counterfactual explanations to understand how changes in input features (e.g., stock price or news sentiment) affect predictions. Show "what-if" scenarios to help stakeholders understand conditions that could lead to different predictions.

### Feature Importance

Evaluate feature importance (e.g., news sentiment, price data, technical indicators) using methods like feature permutation or SHAP. Determine which features influence stock price predictions most.

### LIME

Use **LIME** (Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations) to explain individual predictions made by the LSTM model. Identify which features (like news sentiment or past price movement) influence the model’s decision for specific time steps.

### Saliency Maps & Attention

Implement saliency maps and attention mechanisms to visualize how different time steps or features in the input data (e.g., past prices, news sentiment) influence the LSTM’s output. Gain insights into the temporal dependencies learned by the model.

### SHAP

Use **SHAP** (Shapley Additive Explanations) to calculate the contribution of each feature to the final prediction. This adds another layer of model interpretability.
