# Stock Prediction using LSTM with News & Market Data

## Overview

The goal of this project is to predict stock price movements for a volatile stock by using an LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) model that integrates multiple features, including historical price data, news sentiment, and other market factors. The prediction model will be evaluated with various explainability methods to provide transparency into its decision-making process.

## Why Volatile Stock?

I have chosen **[XYZ Stock]** (e.g., Tesla, Amazon, or any stock with high volatility) for this prediction model due to its price volatility, which makes it a more challenging and realistic target for prediction. Volatile stocks provide more movement, which can be influenced by many factors, including news sentiment, market conditions, and global events. This allows us to evaluate how well the model generalizes when it has to learn from more dynamic and complex data.

## 1. Data Collection

The accuracy of stock price prediction heavily depends on the quality and variety of data. For this project, I will use a combination of:

- **Historical Stock Data**: This provides the foundation for the model, where past price movements (e.g., open, close, high, low, volume) will be used to predict future movements.
- **News Data**: News headlines and articles are an important source of information for predicting stock price movements. The sentiment derived from news can significantly influence price direction.

### News Scraping & APIs
I have selected **[News API Platform]** (e.g., NewsAPI, Alpha Vantage, or another open-source API) for scraping news articles related to the chosen stock. This API was selected because:
- It is **open-source** and offers free access to real-time and historical news articles.
- It provides a **wide range of sources** from reputable news outlets, ensuring diversity in sentiment analysis.
- The API allows filtering by keywords, topics, and stock-related tags, making it easier to focus on relevant news.

### Preprocessing & Structuring
Preprocessing the data will involve cleaning and structuring both stock price data and news data. Steps will include:
- **Stock Data**: Handling missing values, normalizing prices, and creating features such as moving averages, price differences, or volatility indicators.
- **News Data**: Scraping, cleaning, and extracting the sentiment or keywords from the news headlines and articles using Natural Language Processing (NLP) methods.

### Combining with Stock Data
The next step is to merge the news data with historical stock data. This will involve aligning the timestamps of the news with stock data, and creating a dataset that will include:
- Historical stock prices (open, close, high, low, volume)
- Sentiment scores derived from news articles related to the stock
- Technical indicators (e.g., moving averages, RSI)

## 2. Model Training & Evaluation

The core of this project lies in building a predictive model using LSTM.

### Model Selection & Training
I will choose **LSTM** due to its ability to capture time dependencies in sequential data, making it well-suited for time series forecasting tasks like stock price prediction. The model will take in features such as:
- Previous stock prices (historical data)
- Sentiment scores derived from news articles
- Other features like moving averages or market volatility indicators

### Hyperparameter Tuning
LSTM models have a variety of hyperparameters that need to be fine-tuned for optimal performance, including:
- **Number of layers** and **units per layer**
- **Learning rate** and optimizer selection
- **Batch size** and **epochs**

This phase will involve tuning these hyperparameters using techniques such as **Grid Search** or **Random Search**.

### Model Validation & Testing
Once the model is trained, it will be validated using a separate test dataset to check its generalization ability. The validation process will include:
- Evaluating the model’s **accuracy**, **RMSE**, and **mean absolute error (MAE)**
- Comparing the performance against a baseline model that uses only historical stock data without news sentiment.

## 3. Explainability Methods

Understanding and explaining model predictions is crucial for improving model transparency. I will implement several explainability techniques to interpret the LSTM model's outputs.

### Counterfactual Explanations
Counterfactual explanations will be used to understand how changes in the input features (e.g., stock price or news sentiment) affect the prediction. This can show "what-if" scenarios, helping stakeholders understand what conditions would have led to a different prediction.

### Feature Importance
I will evaluate the importance of each feature (such as news sentiment, price data, or technical indicators) using methods like feature permutation or SHAP to understand which factors are most influential in predicting the stock price.

### LIME
LIME (Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations) will be used to explain individual predictions made by the LSTM model. This will allow us to identify which features (like news sentiment or past price movement) were most influential in the model’s decision for a particular time step.

### Saliency Maps & Attention
Saliency maps and attention mechanisms will be implemented to visualize how different time steps or features in the input data (e.g., past prices, news sentiment) influence the LSTM's output. This is crucial for understanding the temporal dependencies the model has learned.

### SHAP
SHAP (Shapley Additive Explanations) will be used to calculate the contribution of each feature to the final prediction, offering another layer of model interpretability.

## Conclusion

This project will leverage an LSTM model to predict stock prices by incorporating both historical data and news sentiment. By combining these features, I aim to build a more robust and accurate predictive model. Through explainability techniques like LIME, SHAP, and attention maps, the goal is to provide transparency into the model's decision-making process, making it easier for stakeholders to understand and trust the model's predictions.
